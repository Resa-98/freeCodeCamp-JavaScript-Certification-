# Variables

## What is it?
A variable is a place to store data. A string is a text data type.

## Why is it important?
So we can store and manipulate information in programs.

## Core Concepts
- `let`, `const`, `var`
- Var 'Is no longer used as a variable because it is usually unclear and often creates bugs in programs'
- Variable names should be descriptive for easy understanding and maintenance.
- Variable names are strongly recommended to be written using camel case, underscores, and the dollar symbol, and should not begin with a number. 


## Code Example
```js
let name;
const age;
var addres;
