# Variables and Strings

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data values.
In JavaScript, variables are declared using `let`, `const`, or `var`.

## Variable Rules

- Use `const` by default
- Use `let` when reassignment is needed
- Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript

## What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
Strings can be wrapped in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

## String Concatenation

String concatenation is the process of joining strings using the `+` operator.

Example:

```js
"My name is " + bot + ".";
```
